<h1> What is Rebohat </h1>

<p> Rebohat is a SPA built with create-react-app tool and laravel for the backend API, it's a simple site that works as a reference for all Sudanese Github repositories</p>


<h2> How it works </h2>

<p>It's quite simple, we store all github usernames in a database, and then rebohat's api does all the fetching of repositories from github via a simple GET request to Github's API</p>


<h3>Want to use Rebohat's api? </h3>
<p>You can access the api via a get request to 'https://backendkham.herokuapp.com/api/show'.
